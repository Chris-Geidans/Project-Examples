This is one of the projects I completed for my web development course while attending Otterbein University.

The purpose of the project was to create webpage that would display the current date and time accurately

as well as display a different image depending on the current time of day.

The topmost image is the one that changes through the day and the bottom one is all potential images that

can be displayed.
